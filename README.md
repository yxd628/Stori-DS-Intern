# Stori-DS-Intern
This repository includes my projects conducted during the internship at Stori

In the first project, I conducted an A/B testing initiative to evaluate the performance differences between two versions of a risk score estimation model. This involved reassigning risk scores across 20 distinct risk bins and analyzing population shifts to identify unexpected behaviors. Additionally, I performed a profound analysis of account statuses for a specific group referred to as "the -1 population," evaluating the better outcomes performed by the new model version compared to the previous version.

The second project is a machine learning-driven initiative which centered around the detection of potential fraud behaviors within transaction history datasets using the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm. I began by performing comprehensive exploratory data analysis to understand transaction patterns and identify key trends. Implementing the LOF algorithm, I successfully identified local outliers indicative of fraudulent transactions characterized by unusual spending behavior, achieving a 94% classification accuracy. To ensure the clarity and accessibility of the results, I created and enhanced visualizations of the classification outcomes using scatterplots and color mapping, which facilitated strong and intuitive data interpretation.
